# FFRD Devcontainer Template
Devcontainers allow interactive development inside of a docker container using VSCode. 

This devcontainer creates a reproducible environment for python projects using micromamba    
environments (faster/more robust version of conda). 

When opening this repository in VSCode, you may be prompted to re-open the project in devcontainer.  
Alternatively, you may access this option through the  
View menu -> Command Palette -> DevContainers: Reopen in Container.

Other requirements:
1. An environment file (env.yaml) is required placed in the .devcontainer folder of the  
project for a reproducible python environment to be succussfully built.
2. A docker engine installed locally (Docker Desktop or other).
